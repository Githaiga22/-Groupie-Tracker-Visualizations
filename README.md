   - Locations
   - First album release date
   - Creation date

### Project Objectives
The Groupie-Tracker Visualizations project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that displays artist data from an API in an accessible and visually appealing format. The project objectives include:

1.   Data Management: Effectively manipulate, store, and display artist data from the API to enhance user experience.

2.  Search Functionality: Implement a case-insensitive search bar with real-time suggestions, categorizing results by type (e.g., artist, member).

3.  User Interface Design: Follow Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design for a seamless experience:
      - Strive for consistency in design elements and interaction.
      - Enable frequent users to use shortcuts for efficiency.
      - Offer informative feedback to guide user actions.
      - Design dialogues to yield closure by providing clear completion feedback.
      - Provide simple error handling with intuitive responses to user errors.
      - Permit easy reversal of actions to encourage exploration.
      - Support an internal locus of control so users feel in command of the interface.
      - Reduce short-term memory load by keeping interactions simple and intuitive.

4. HTML and JavaScript Integration: Use these tools to dynamically handle events, display search suggestions, and enhance overall interactivity.
